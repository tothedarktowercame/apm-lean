# APM a98A02

## Statement repairs

None.

## Encoding questions

None. A function defined measurably on `[0,1]` is represented by an ambient
function whose zero extension from `[0,1]` is measurable. Membership in
`L¹[0,1]` is encoded by `IntegrableOn` for Lebesgue measure, and the Kronecker
delta is written as `if n = m then 1 else 0`.
