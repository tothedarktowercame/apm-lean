# APM t03J02: two tori glued along null-homotopic circles

## Statement repairs

None.

## Encoding questions

Each simple closed curve is encoded by a topological embedding of the actual
circle into the standard torus, together with null-homotopy of that map.  The
two parameterizations encode the specified homeomorphism between the curves.
The glued space is the genuine quotient, and the free product of two copies
of `ℤ²` is given by its four-generator, two-commutator presentation.

  Closer hop 1 packages the quotient data explicitly:
  `apm_t03J02_quotientMap` is proved continuous and surjective, and
  `apm_t03J02_glue_eq` proves the two circle parameterizations have identical
  images pointwise in the quotient. This follows the useful quotient-map layer
  extracted in siblings `t02A03` and `t00A01`.

  Searches of `LEMMA-INDEX.md`, `ConstructionTargets/`, all topology siblings,
  Mathlib's `FundamentalGroupoid`, `TopCat` limits, singular homology, pushout,
  and Mayer--Vietoris sources, plus git history, found no theorem promoting
  this `EqvGen` quotient to a topological pushout with a van Kampen computation,
  and no singular Mayer--Vietoris sequence. Mathlib also lacks the required
  concrete computations of the torus fundamental group and homology in this
  encoding. Thus the remaining bridge is substantial algebraic-topology
  infrastructure, not quotient bookkeeping; the frozen statement is unchanged.

  CLOSER HOP 2: the quotient is now promoted from a cocone to its full
  function-level continuous pushout property. `apm_t03J02_gluedDesc_respects`
  proves compatible maps on the two tori respect the generated relation;
  `apm_t03J02_gluedDesc` descends them continuously; its two simp lemmas
  recover the original restrictions; and `apm_t03J02_gluedDesc_unique` proves
  uniqueness by quotient induction. Thus the concrete space is no longer
  missing a topological eliminator. Renewed searches of `LEMMA-INDEX.md`,
  `ConstructionTargets/`, all topology artifacts, Mathlib's fundamental-group
  pushout, singular homology, Mayer--Vietoris, and torus sources, and git
  history still found no Seifert--van Kampen theorem, singular
  Mayer--Vietoris sequence, or concrete torus invariant computation. The
  remaining bridge is now entirely functorial algebraic topology; the frozen
  statement is unchanged.

  CLOSER HOP 3 strengthens the eliminator into an explicit universal-property
  equivalence. `apm_t03J02_gluedInl` and `apm_t03J02_gluedInr` are the two
  continuous coprojections, `apm_t03J02_CompatibleMaps` packages compatible
  pairs, and `apm_t03J02_gluedDescEquiv` proves that maps from the quotient are
  equivalent to such pairs, with both inverse laws compiled. This removes any
  remaining ambiguity about the concrete quotient being the intended maps-out
  pushout. Searches of categorical pushout preservation by singular homology,
  fundamental groupoids, and derived-colimit/Mayer--Vietoris APIs found no
  theorem converting this universal property into the frozen invariants.
  Hence the remaining bridge is still the absent functorial algebraic topology
  and concrete torus computations; the frozen statement is unchanged.
