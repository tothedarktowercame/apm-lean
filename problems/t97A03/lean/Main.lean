## Statement repairs

None.

## Encoding questions

The base and both pictured covers are concrete adjunction-space quotients.
The base glues two marked circle points to the poles of `S²`. The cover
pictures glue two sphere sheets to either one lifted circle at four points or
two lifted circles at two points each. Homology is Mathlib integral singular
homology, and the fundamental group is the actual based fundamental group.

  New progress: `apm_t97A03_surjective_of_fiber_card_two` proves that the
  frozen cardinality condition makes `p` surjective, by showing an omitted
  base point would have an empty fiber of cardinality zero.  Hence subsequent
  work may treat `p` as a genuine connected two-sheeted covering without
  separately recovering surjectivity from `IsCoveringMap`.

  The remaining theorem requires three major bridges.  First, the concrete
  EqvGen quotient for the base must be identified up to homotopy with
  `S² ∨ S¹ ∨ S¹`, and connected degree-two coverings must be classified by
  the three index-two subgroups of its `F₂` fundamental group, then matched to
  the two frozen quotient models.  Second, the cellular chain complex of each
  quotient must be connected to Mathlib singular homology to obtain ranks
  `1,3,2`.  Third, the covering injection on fundamental groups must be
  combined with a quantitative Nielsen--Schreier rank formula to obtain
  `FreeGroup (Fin 3)`.

  Searches of `LEMMA-INDEX.md`, `ConstructionTargets/`, all closed artifacts,
  Mathlib's covering/lifting/fundamental-groupoid, singular-homology,
  free-group, Schreier, and Nielsen--Schreier sources, and git history found no
  classification of connected coverings by subgroups, no CW/cellular homology
  comparison for these adjunction quotients, and no finite-index free-rank
  equality.  Mathlib proves only that subgroups of free groups are free and
  provides Schreier rank bounds; sibling `t00J08` independently records the
  missing quantitative equality, while `t94J04`, `t01A04`, and `t93A03`
  record the unavailable subgroup-cover and wedge fundamental-group bridges.
  Thus none of the six frozen conjuncts can yet be obtained merely by
  transporting through an existing classification theorem.

  Closer hop 2 exposes the base adjunction's two generating equalities as
  `apm_t97A03_base_north_eq` and `apm_t97A03_base_south_eq`. These are the
  exact point-set attachments needed by a future van Kampen or cellular model,
  but they do not supply either comparison theorem or the covering/subgroup
  classification, so the six-conjunct bridge remains open.
